# Personal Website v2.0

![Screen Shot 2021-08-18 at 1 49 10 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44681827/129844408-81cee7c5-3dea-45b8-9873-98ca89e35305.png)

This repository houses the source and build files for the latest version of personal CV website. The website is built using React, React Bootstrap components, and React Router for client-side routing. It contains information about myself, specifically my interests, work experiences, and software projects. I've also started a small (but growing) blog about my passions besides coding. Feel free to check it out here: https://www.melvinrajendran.com.

In many ways, this site has been my web dev playground, and I've used it to apply new skills that I've learned. I'll continue to add projects and features to it in the future. In the meantime, I would be happy to hear any feedback as to what improvements I could make.

## Notes on v1.0

Version 1.0 of my personal website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. It contained a lot of the same theming and content as v2.0, but also used tons of repetitive code that has now been consolidated through ES6 mapping and React components. The code is no longer available on GitHub, as I believe the current website is the best reflection of my skills as of now.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
